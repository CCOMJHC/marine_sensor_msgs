# A collection of marine radar rays, typically covering a contiguous
# arc of a full circle.

Header header            # timestamp in the header is the acquisition time of 
                         # the first ray in the scan.
                         #
                         # in frame frame_id, angles are measured around 
                         # the positive Z axis (counterclockwise, if Z is up)
                         # with zero angle being forward along the x axis

float32 angle_start      # start angle of the scan [rad]
float32 angle_increment  # angular distance between measurements [rad]

float32 time_increment   # time between rays [seconds] - if your scanner
                         # is moving, this will be used in interpolating position
                         # of 3d points
float32 scan_time        # time between complete scans [seconds]

float32 range_min        # minimum range value [m]
float32 range_max        # maximum range value [m]

RadarEcho[] intensities  # intensity data [device-specific units].  If your
                         # device does not provide intensities, please leave
                         # the array empty.
